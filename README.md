# Hello
EEE/CSE student. I make things from scratch to understand how they work.  
No tutorials when exploring a subject for fun (particulary in [Excursions](https://github.com/Adi-Vat/Excursions/tree/main)) to maintain curiosity and obsession :)  
Each project starts with a question.  
Mainly hardware/physics adjacent projects. I also work on Team Bath Heart as the head of the VR development subteam.
